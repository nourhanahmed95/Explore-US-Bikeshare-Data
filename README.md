# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
# Overview
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

# What software Do You Need?
You should have Python 3, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter notebook installed using Anaconda.
